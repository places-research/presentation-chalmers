You have my resume and all information you need to understand the my technical career. I prepared this presentation to let you know who I am, how my previous experiences as an engineer, teacher and researcher has shaped me and my expectations of opportunities in Chalmers and how can I contribute to Chalmers.

I was born in a traditional, medium-class Brazilian family, back in 1979. Besides my parents, who look like they have just come out of a TV series from the 80's, my grandmother played an important party in this first stage of my life.

I was born in Belo Horizonte, this big, young and inequitable, metropolitan area in the southeast of Brazil. As other cities and metropolises in Brazil, it has car-oriented planners, very little public transport and street design that does not allow pedestrians and bicycles to get around safely. In addition to all that, lots of inequalities, poverty and security issues.

I had a traditional adolescence, going crazy at the first time I played in the snow! This happened in my first international experience: a high school exchange program in Idaho-US.

My ecumene kept enlarging!

The second part I proposed for this presentation concerns the more deductive part of my life. Less exploration, more acquisition of knowledge, and mostly I found myself entrapped in an unequal and hypothetical world.

Another 15 years of my life.

These were times to get a Bachelor's and Master's degree, a Postgraduation diploma, some professional experience and a lot of teaching experience! And a lot of LOVE! I kept expanding my ecumene and enhancing distances from the real tangible world (besides motherhood! what a well-grounded challenge!)

During my undergraduate studies, I explored possibilities that were a game changer in my professional journey. 

I was a member of the students council and responsible for institutional representation of s students body

I joined an Undergrauduate Program for Scientific Initiation in the project entitled ‚ÄúResidential Mobility and Transportation System in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte‚Äù.

And in my final semester, I enrolled myself in transportation engineering courses. 

Transportation was the only field of knowledge in my course that allowed me to identify challenges directly related to people.

I wasn't sure I was well instructed to work as an transportation engineer. So I decided to get a master's degree. Once more, my ecumene expanded to Rio de Janeiro! But, since I had been working since I was 16 years-old, I decided to go back to Belo Horizonte and work while finishing the thesis. In the mean time....

## Social-transformative education 
Those truly committed to liberation must (‚Ä¶) abandon the educational goal of deposit-making and replace it with the posing of problems of human beings in their relations with the world. ‚ÄúProblem-posing‚Äù education, responding to the essence of consciousness ‚Äì intentionality ‚Äì rejects communiqu√©s and embodies communication. (Freire, 1968/2000, p. 79).

Social transformative education asks for a different positioning of students, teachers and societal partners such that one does not dominate or impose upon the other, but that they jointly learn about and change the conditions of society.

As a group students will propose a social challenge they want to address. As a group, including teachers and societal partners, they will formulate their research problem in a way that challenges their student-centric view and opens up their minds to alternative perspectives. Within this educational setting, all parties participate as researchers ‚Äì Freire called this the collaboration between the teacher-students and the student-teachers.

Together they look into the social challenges and redefine the challenges as well as their solutions. This form of education is not only about ‚Äòwhat is‚Äô, with all the subjectivity that this implies, but also about ‚Äòwhat could be‚Äô, squarely opposed to the false neutrality of the ‚Äòbanking‚Äô mode of education imposed from the teacher to the individual student.

- social-transformative education Teacher suggesting confronting ideas that force the students to consider new information in a holistic, interdisciplinary manner helps to articulate the student‚Äôs worldview into a broader picture

resisted by education managers, ministries of education and many teachers until either the approach is watered down such that the projects are no longer problem-oriented or dropped altogether

emancipating and promoting the autonomy and protagonism
of people, preferably from the most vulnerable classes, through the Pedagogy of Autonomy
and liberating education.

to free oneself from the
heteronomies imposed by the constituted powers, characterized by selective, oppressive and
excluding political and economic systems, in order to become a subject, with time and voice,
author of his thinking and acting in the world.

At the beginning of my career I believed that Transportation Technology and Mobility Systems were the final objective of my professional activity, as an engineer, as a teacher and as a researcher. I believes that professional success would be achieved through corporate (mostly financial) results. I thought I could change the World (even if I tried by myself). 

Along the way, I became more humble; undestood that I could not change the world, specially alone; and that success and self-accomplishment are results of interactions, are result of connections and from exchange. My place in the world became much more responsible, fun and diverse. Today, my goal in the world is to interact with people and for people, as a teacher and as a researcher. I want to build connections and not bridges. 

Consolidate PLACES research group + Interaction among departments.

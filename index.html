I was born in a traditional Brazilian family, back in 1979. Besides my parents, who look like they have just come out of a TV series from the 80's, my grandmother played an important party in this first stage of my life.

I was born in Belo Horizonte, this crazy big and young metropolitan area in the southeast of Brazil. Crazy as every urban area with car-oriented planners, very little public transport and street design that does not allow pedestrians and bicycles to get around safely.

For those of you that do not know where Belo Horizonte is, here is a little hint!

I had a traditional adolescence, going crazy at the first time I played in the snow! This happened in my first international experience: a high school exchange program in Idaho-US.

It is hard to tell which picture I am more ashamed of. But my ecumene kept enlarging!

The second part I proposed for this presentation concerns the more deductive part of my life. Less exploration, more acquisition of knowledge, and mostly I found myself entrapped in an unequal and hypothetical world.

Another 15 years of my life

These were times to get a Bachelor's and Master's degree, a Postgraduation diploma, some professional experience and a lot of teaching experience! And a lot of LOVE! I kept expanding my ecumene and enhancing distances from the real tangible world (besides motherhood! what a well-grounded challenge!)

During my undergraduate studies, I explored possibilities that were a game changer in my professional journey. 

I was a member of the students council and responsible for institutional representation of s students body

I joined an Undergrauduate Program for Scientific Initiation in the project entitled ‚ÄúResidential Mobility and Transportation System in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte‚Äù.

And in my final semester, I enrolled myself in transportation engineering courses. 

Transportation was the only field of knowledge in my course that allowed me to identify challenges directly related to people.

I wasn't sure I was well instructed to work as an transportation engineer. So I decided to get a master's degree. Once more, my ecumene expanded to Rio de Janeiro! But, since I had been working since I was 16 years-old, I decided to go back to Belo Horizonte and work while finishing the thesis. In the mean time....
